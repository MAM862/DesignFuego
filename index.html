<!--Welcome to "Projects Fuego..." Just follow along with comments like this one, and you'll design a really cool webtext that not only introduces you, your skills, and interests to the rest of the class, but also builds your coding literacy. Refer to the repository README for GitHub publishing help.-->

<!--BTW. You can leave these faded code comments be, or delete them. Programmers and web designers use these comments to better explain what the code is doing for others who may enter the document later. They are but road signs, absent from the larger design-->

<!--HTML pages start by calling <!DOCTYPE html> and designating a language.-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <!--Next comes the <head> information including the title and all of the important links that make the webtext work. When a browser access your url, it looks first at the index.html document <head> to learn about the names and locations of the other files and assets it will need to assemble your code into a visual display.-->

  <!--Go ahead and fill in the blank in <title>I am...</title> (see just below). The <title> will appear in your document's browser tab-->
<title>I am ...</title>
<!--The stuff below the title does important work to tell browsers what this page should look like on different screens-->
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
<!--Next is a link to the cascading style sheet or CSS. Web designers use a cascading stylesheet CSS to add styling to a website. Designers do this by "calling" a <div class> in HTML and defining the class attributes on the style sheet. Doing so saves time and results in less code. On the style.css page you'll find attributes relating font, text size, image size, among other details.-->
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">
</head>


<body>
<!--Now we will start working in the body of the document. The body holds all of the code and content that will appear as a visual for our audience.-->

<!--Designers refer to this next section as a "Hero Image." The hero image is styled on the style.css page by calling a "class." To replace the hero image, simply place a .jpg file in the same file folder (directory) as this project and name it "hero.jpg." Alternatively, if you are working with a .png, you will need to open the style.css file using your text editor, find the "hero-image" class and change the file type from ".jpg" to ".png."" Browsers will only work with .jpg, .jpeg, or .png images. Since hero images need to stretch across the screen, typically you will want to select an image 1200px in width to allow quick load time yet avoid pixilation.-->

<!--We'll use this first section to discuss where you are right now. Where do you go to school and what courses are you taking/enjoying. What majors/minors/certificates are you pursuing? Has this changed? Why? Replace the content between <h3> and </h3> that says "Lorem ipsum" etc -->


<!--Fuego programs sometimes use "in-line styling" to provide quick fixes to content design. In the above case, you could change "left" to "right" or "center" depending on your specific design needs. That said, left align is usually best practice for improving readability.-->

  <h2>Field of Study</h2>
  <h3>I am a Senior here at the University of Pittsburgh. I am studying Communications, Minoring in Economics, and pursuing a Digital Media certificate. Some of the courses that I have enjoyed most in my time here at Pitt include Website design and development and Marketing courses. Entering my first year, I was studying Biology on a Pre-PT track; I quickly realized that I was no longer interested in science after taking Gen-ed classes that Pitt had to offer. Which led me to choose Communications and Digital Media.</h3>

<!--Replace the images here. You can also control max-image width%. Keep your file names simple, don't use spaces, and be case sensitive). Be sure to add alt="text." Visually impaired individuals using screen readers rely on alt="text" to describe pictures to them. Describe your image as clearly and succinctly as possible.-->

<!--What experience do you have to leverage in this class? Are you a writer, are you a maker, are you a designer, are you a thinker or critic? What is your medium/media? What interests you about that medium/those media? What media/skills do you wish to learn more about/pursue in this class?-->

<div class="textblock" style="text-align: left">
  <h2>Knowledge, Tools, and Skills</h2>
    <h3>Some of the skills I have learned in previous classes, including Marketing and Website Design and Development, will play a massive role in this class. I have experience in the basics of HTML and CSS, including an introduction to JavaScript. Marketing will help with this class to communicate a customer’s wants and needs better through design. I am currently employed at Tom’s Watch Bar, where I serve. Along with that, I help create content and run the social media. For that position, I work with various media, including photography, a camera, and my laptop for editing purposes. I wish to learn more about how I can become a better designer for social media purposes and potential digital marketing jobs. </h3>

<!--Quick fact: Did you know "Lorem ipsum," the fill text used in this web template, was hacked out of Cicero's "De finibus bonorum et malorum"? Developers made it non-sensical, so don't bother with Google Translate.-->

<!--So, what exactly is good design? Take some time to explain your design interests...defining it, providing examples, explaining why is it important/significant-->
<div class="textblock" style="text-align: left">
  <h2>What is good design?</h2>
      <h3>“Good design,” by definition, involves several things. For me, good design requires creativity, simplicity, and aesthetics. In my experience with social media, creativity plays a key role. For example, I want to grab people’s attention and not post what everyone else posts. Of course, staying in the loop with trends is crucial, but being creative and making minor changes to trends can make one profile stand out. Simplicity keeps everything organized or “simple” while still having a wow factor to my design. Which then leads me to aesthetics or visual consistency. For example, keeping an aesthetically pleasing profile (color scheme, consistent fonts, and filters) keeps customers engaged and can easily consume my content.

<!--Let's talk a little about the future. After school what kind of job or career would you like to pursue? What is your reasoning for going on this path? How might it connect to all of these prior elements-field of study, home and family, interests and activities? How might the work we do in this space help you to realize this future?-->

<div class="textblock" style="text-align: left">
   <h2>In the Future</h2>
      <h3>After school, I plan to continue my education and pursue an MBA. After grad school, I plan to enter the field of digital marketing and social media. These areas connect to my current communications, economics, and digital media studies by equipping me with practical communication skills, knowledge of economics and market trends, and an understanding of various platforms and tools. Although my family primarily pursues careers in the medical field, they have been incredibly supportive and open-minded throughout my college years at Pitt, taking an interest in my future career aspirations. Our work in this space will significantly benefit me in future job positions and my current role as a social media intern.</h3>
